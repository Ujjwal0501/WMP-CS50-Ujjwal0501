1.  "stdint.h" is a header file which is used to declare and utilize properties of fixed width integer datatypes.
2.  Using these types, we can explicitly specify a limit on the max and min values of identifiers of these type, unlike system dependent limit of int datatype.
3.  BYTE = 1 byte
    DWORD = 4 bytes
    LONG = 4 bytes
    WORD = 2 bytes
4.  In hexadecimal these are: 0x42 and 0x4D.
5.  'biSize' gives bytes of image with padding, while 'bfSize' stores size of full file including padding, infoheader and file header size.
6.  Negative biHeight indicates that the BMP file starts from top-left corner and the image is top-down.
7.  'biBitCount' specifies the color depth.
8.  It may happen that the file was not open (as it was not on disk or have been removed), in such a case the return value of 'fopen' function will be 'NULL' indicating the same.
9.  This part is to specify the number of reads are to made from the file specified. In our case, we always read one pixel at a time and so, we always copied only one time.
10. 3
11. 'fseek' function is used to skip over the bytes in file. It moves the read/write pointer while a file is being read/written.
12. A function such as 'fseek' sometiems perform seek relative to current position of cursor. The 'SEEK_CUR' is used to specify the current cursor position implicitly.
