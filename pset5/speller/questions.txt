0.  'pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis' is a synonym to a lung disease, silicosis, which is caused by inhaling very fine ash and sand dust.
1.  'getrusage' returns resource usage info by the function whose name is passed as argument.
2.  16
3.  Passing them by value will create a copy of those contents while passing by reference only directs the called function to their location in memory. Thus, saving time and memory.
4.  Inside the loop each character from text file is read one at a time. Then that character is checked if it is an alphabet or apostrophe and other characters are ignored (thus ignorng alphanumeric strings). If the character continues to be an alphabet or apostrophe it's added to the word being read. Meanwhile if length of word is greater than maximum length specified, that word is droped. After a word is read successfully, the word count is increased by 1. Then that word is checked if it exists in dictionary, by calling the check function and passing pointer to the word read from file. The check function is surrounded by resource usage calculator functions which calculates time taken for each search. The boolean value returned by check is inspected and then control passes to the while loop.
5.  'fscanf' copies one word at a time, whose length may be anything thus making it dificult to allocate memory beforehand (allocating memory prior to its use may also result in wastage in some cases). Scanning whole at one go will pose difficulty in distinguishing a string from being a english word, as we then have to run one more loop for this job.
6.  These functions accept parameters whose values once assigned should not change. Making them constant adds more security to change of value.
